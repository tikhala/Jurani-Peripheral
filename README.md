# Jurani-Peripheral
A peripheral device for Jurani facial recognition model: run on ESP development board, TFT Lcd and Ardu-Camera

doing something similar to this https://bitluni.net/esp32-i2s-camera-ov7670

running the peripheral device using micropython loaded on the dev board

Plan to use these micro-python libraries for the project

the Ov series camera i was using had some issues with dependencies. it seems the problem may either be with the camera-arduino connectivity or the example code i was using
